# Shopper-Mapper

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Descriptions

Sometimes you don’t want to go to the coolest, newest place. You just want to go to a regular restaurant, bar, grocery store, or coffee shop.

## Requirements

•Use the MapQuest API
•A user should be able to use their current location or input a location as a base
•The user should be able to type in a query (e.g. clothing, museums, coffee shop, bar, etc.)
•Users can see every instance of that thing within 10km of the base location ordered by relevance.
•The middle location of the returned list should be highlighted. (If it’s an even number, the middle two.)
•User should be able to choose a returned destination and get directions from the base location to that destination
•Proper error handling. For example:
•If a user types in a query that yields no result - they should be provided feedback (e.g. there were no items found)
•Common error responses should be handled
•API loading states
